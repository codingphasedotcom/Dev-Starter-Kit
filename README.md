# Starter-Kit-2019


So I built this for all the new web developers... My Goal is to save you time from the bullsh*t of spending hours looking for ways to speed up your learning. Sometimes all we want to do is just code.
(if you are coming from my  [youtube channel CodingPhase ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC46wWUso9H5KPQcoL9iE3Ug) I will base all my tutorials from this starter kit)

I broke it down in simple steps to get you going.

**Steps**
---------

**Download or Pull This Repo**
	Top of this page you can see where it says clone or download

 **Install Node**
	https://nodejs.org/en/

**Download Atom (OPTIONAL)**
	https://atom.io/

 **Install all the node packages** 
On the root of this project run on your terminal (if you want you can do this with yarn but thats optional)
```bash
    sudo npm install har-validator@latest --save-dev
    sudo npm install
    sudo npm install gulp@3.9.1 -g 
    sudo npm install webpack -g
    sudo npm install webpack-cli -g
```
    

**Start the dev server**
```bash
  npm run watch
```
